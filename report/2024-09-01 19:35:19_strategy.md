# Strategy Description:
**Mean Reversion Strategy: Bollinger Band Squeeze**

**Objective:** Identify stocks experiencing low volatility and capitalize on subsequent price movements.

**Strategy:**

1. **Data Requirements:** Daily stock prices (Close, High, Low)
2. **Indicators:**
	* Bollinger Bands (20-day moving average, 2 standard deviations)
	* Bollinger Band Width (BBW) = (Upper BB - Lower BB) / Moving Average
3. **Entry Rules:**
	* Long: When BBW falls below 5% (indicating low volatility) and the stock price touches the lower Bollinger Band.
	* Short: When BBW falls below 5% and the stock price touches the upper Bollinger Band.
4. **Exit Rules:**
	* Long: When the stock price reaches the upper Bollinger Band or BBW exceeds 10%.
	* Short: When the stock price reaches the lower Bollinger Band or BBW exceeds 10%.
5. **Position Sizing:** 2% of equity per trade.

**Rationale:** The strategy exploits the tendency of stocks to revert to their mean price after periods of low volatility. By entering trades when volatility is low and exiting when it increases, we aim to capture a portion of the subsequent price movement.

# Analysis:
**Strategy Performance Analysis: Bollinger Band Squeeze**

**Overview**

The Bollinger Band Squeeze strategy aims to capitalize on the mean reversion phenomenon in stock prices by identifying periods of low volatility and entering trades in anticipation of subsequent price movements. This analysis evaluates the strategy's performance based on the provided statistics.

**Key Performance Metrics**

1. **Annual Return**: The strategy has generated an impressive annual return of 100.83%, indicating a significant potential for growth.
2. **Drawdown**: The maximum drawdown of 44.79% is substantial, suggesting that the strategy is not immune to significant losses. This highlights the importance of proper risk management and position sizing.
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: Unfortunately, the Sharpe ratio is not available, which makes it challenging to assess the strategy's risk-adjusted performance. However, we can still analyze other metrics to gain insights into the strategy's behavior.
4. **Trade Performance**: The strategy has executed only 2 trades, both of which were winners. While this is a positive sign, it is essential to note that the sample size is extremely small, and more trades are needed to confirm the strategy's efficacy.

**Trade Characteristics**

1. **Trade Frequency**: With only 2 trades executed, the strategy can be considered a low-frequency trading approach.
2. **Win/Loss Ratio**: The strategy has a perfect win/loss ratio, with both trades resulting in profits. However, this is likely due to the small sample size.
3. **Position Sizing**: The position size of 2% of equity per trade is relatively conservative, which may help mitigate potential losses.

**Strategy Strengths**

1. **High Annual Return**: The strategy's annual return is impressive, indicating potential for significant growth.
2. **Mean Reversion Concept**: The strategy is based on a well-known and researched concept, which adds credibility to its approach.

**Strategy Weaknesses**

1. **Small Sample Size**: The strategy's performance is based on only 2 trades, which makes it challenging to draw conclusive insights.
2. **High Drawdown**: The maximum drawdown is substantial, highlighting the need for proper risk management and position sizing.
3. **Lack of Sharpe Ratio**: The absence of a Sharpe ratio makes it difficult to assess the strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

**Recommendations**

1. **Increase Sample Size**: Execute more trades to confirm the strategy's efficacy and gain a better understanding of its performance.
2. **Monitor and Adjust Risk Management**: Closely monitor the strategy's performance and adjust position sizing and risk management parameters as needed to minimize potential losses.
3. **Consider Additional Metrics**: Incorporate additional metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the strategy's risk-adjusted performance.

In conclusion, while the Bollinger Band Squeeze strategy shows promise, its performance is based on a limited sample size, and more trades are needed to confirm its efficacy. It is essential to continue monitoring the strategy's performance, adjusting risk management parameters as needed, and incorporating additional metrics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its behavior.
