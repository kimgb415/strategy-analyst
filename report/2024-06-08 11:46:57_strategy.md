# Strategy Description:
**Revised Strategy: Enhanced Mean Reversion with Adaptive Bollinger Bands and Volatility Filter**

**Stock Selection:** Any liquid stock with a minimum 2-year price history and average daily trading volume above 1 million shares.

**Entry Rules:**

1. Calculate the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the stock's closing price.
2. Calculate the adaptive Bollinger Bands (ABB) with a 2-standard deviation range, where the standard deviation is adjusted based on the 10-day average true range (ATR).
3. Calculate the 10-day ATR to measure volatility.
4. When the stock's closing price touches or breaks below the lower ABB and the 10-day ATR is below 1.25, buy the stock.
5. When the stock's closing price touches or breaks above the upper ABB and the 10-day ATR is above 1.25, sell the stock.

**Exit Rules:**

1. Set a stop-loss at 1.25% below the entry price.
2. Set a take-profit at 1.25% above the entry price.

**Position Sizing:** Allocate 1.25% of the trading account to each trade, with a maximum of 3 open positions.

**Risk Management:**

1. Implement a 1.5% daily loss limit and a 3% weekly loss limit.
2. If the strategy experiences a 7% drawdown, reduce position sizing by 25% until the strategy recovers to a 3% drawdown.
3. If the strategy experiences a 12% drawdown, reduce position sizing by 50% until the strategy recovers to a 5% drawdown.

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Adaptive Bollinger Bands:** The ABB adjusts the standard deviation based on the 10-day ATR, making the strategy more responsive to changing market conditions.
2. **Tighter Volatility Filter:** The revised volatility filter uses a 1.25 ATR threshold, reducing the likelihood of trading during periods of high volatility.
3. **Refined Position Sizing:** The allocation of 1.25% of the trading account to each trade, with a maximum of 3 open positions, aims to balance risk and potential returns.
4. **Enhanced Risk Management:** The revised risk management approach includes more stringent daily and weekly loss limits, as well as drawdown-based position sizing adjustments to mitigate potential losses.

By addressing the concerns raised in the critique, this revised strategy aims to provide a better risk-return profile, increase trading activity, and reduce the impact of large drawdowns.

# Strategy Performance:
PerformanceMetrics(sharpe=-2.673205142712835, drawdown=3.50399320231465, annual_return=-0.09237417906964078, total_trades=599, winning_trades=270, losing_trades=329)

# Analysis:
**Detailed Analysis of the Revised Strategy's Performance**

Based on the provided statistics, I will conduct a thorough analysis of the revised strategy's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

**Risk-Adjusted Performance:**

The Sharpe Ratio, a key metric for evaluating risk-adjusted performance, stands at -2.6732. This indicates that the strategy's returns are not sufficient to compensate for the level of risk taken. A negative Sharpe Ratio suggests that the strategy is not generating excess returns relative to the risk-free rate, and investors may be better off investing in a risk-free asset.

**Drawdown:**

The maximum drawdown of 3.503993% is a concern, as it indicates that the strategy is prone to significant losses. A drawdown of this magnitude can be detrimental to investor confidence and may lead to a reduction in capital allocation.

**Annual Return:**

The annual return of -0.092374% is disappointing, indicating that the strategy is not generating positive returns over the long term. This is a significant concern, as investors expect a trading strategy to generate returns that outperform the broader market.

**Trade Performance:**

The total number of trades (599) suggests that the strategy is moderately active, with an average of approximately 1.64 trades per week. However, the winning trades (270) to losing trades (329) ratio is concerning, indicating that the strategy is not consistently profitable.

**Win Rate and Loss Rate:**

The win rate (45.07%) is relatively low, suggesting that the strategy is not accurately identifying profitable trading opportunities. The loss rate (54.93%) is higher than the win rate, which contributes to the overall negative performance.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Risk Management:** While the revised strategy includes enhanced risk management features, the drawdown and Sharpe Ratio suggest that these measures may not be sufficient to mitigate risk.
2. **Trade Selection:** The strategy's trade selection process may need to be refined to improve the win rate and reduce the number of losing trades.
3. **Return Generation:** The strategy's inability to generate positive returns is a significant concern and may require adjustments to the entry and exit rules or position sizing.
4. **Volatility Filter:** The revised volatility filter may not be effective in reducing the impact of high-volatility periods, as evidenced by the drawdown and negative returns.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Refine Trade Selection:** Consider incorporating additional technical or fundamental indicators to improve the accuracy of trade selection.
2. **Adjust Position Sizing:** Re-evaluate the position sizing strategy to ensure that it is optimal for the revised risk management approach.
3. **Enhance Risk Management:** Consider implementing more aggressive risk management measures, such as dynamic position sizing or stop-loss adjustments, to mitigate potential losses.
4. **Monitor and Refine:** Continuously monitor the strategy's performance and refine the approach as needed to address the identified weaknesses.

By addressing these concerns and refining the strategy, it may be possible to improve its risk-return profile and generate more consistent profits.
