# Strategy Description:
**Improved Strategy Description:**

**Strategy:** Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands

**Stock Selection:** Any liquid stock with a minimum 5-year price history

**Entry Rules:**

1. Calculate the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the stock's closing price.
2. Calculate the 1.5-standard deviation Bollinger Bands around the 20-day EMA.
3. When the stock's closing price touches the lower Bollinger Band and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is below 30, buy the stock.
4. When the stock's closing price touches the upper Bollinger Band and the 14-day RSI is above 70, sell the stock.

**Exit Rules:**

1. Set a stop-loss at 2% below the entry price.
2. Set a take-profit at 2% above the entry price.

**Position Sizing:** Allocate 2% of the trading account to each trade, with a maximum of 8 open positions at any given time. The position size will be adjusted based on the trading account's performance, with a maximum daily allocation of 10% and a maximum weekly allocation of 20%.

**Risk Management:**

1. Monitor the strategy's performance regularly and adjust position sizing based on the trading account's performance.
2. Implement a maximum daily loss limit of 1.5% of the trading account.
3. Implement a maximum weekly loss limit of 3% of the trading account.
4. Implement a maximum monthly loss limit of 5% of the trading account.

**Backtesting:**

The strategy will be backtested over a 15-year period with a dataset of 1,000 liquid stocks. The backtesting results will be used to refine the strategy and optimize its performance.

**Performance Metrics:**

The strategy's performance will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. Annual Return
2. Sharpe Ratio
3. Drawdown
4. Total Trades
5. Winning Trades
6. Losing Trades
7. Average Trade Return
8. Average Trade Duration
9. Sortino Ratio
10. Calmar Ratio

By addressing the critique's recommendations, this improved strategy aims to increase trading activity, optimize position sizing, and refine risk management to provide a more reliable source of returns for investors.

# Analysis:
**Detailed Analysis of the Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands Strategy**

Based on the provided statistics, I will provide a comprehensive analysis of the strategy's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

**Return Analysis**

The strategy's annual return is 2.21%, which is relatively low compared to other trading strategies. This suggests that the strategy may not be generating sufficient returns to justify the risks taken.

**Risk Analysis**

The strategy's Sharpe Ratio is -15.41, indicating that the returns generated are not sufficient to compensate for the risks taken. A negative Sharpe Ratio implies that the strategy is not efficient in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

The maximum drawdown of 20.40% is relatively high, suggesting that the strategy is exposed to significant potential losses. This could be a concern for investors with a low risk tolerance.

**Trade Analysis**

The strategy has executed a total of 181 trades, with a winning trade percentage of 53.6% (97 winning trades out of 181). While the winning trade percentage is slightly above 50%, the average trade return is not provided, making it difficult to assess the strategy's profitability.

**Position Sizing and Risk Management**

The strategy's position sizing is based on a 2% allocation per trade, with a maximum of 8 open positions at any given time. The maximum daily allocation is 10%, and the maximum weekly allocation is 20%. These parameters suggest that the strategy is designed to manage risk through diversification and position sizing.

The strategy's risk management framework includes a stop-loss of 3% below the entry price and a take-profit of 3% above the entry price. Additionally, the strategy has daily, weekly, and monthly loss limits of 1.5%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. These risk management measures are designed to limit potential losses and protect the trading account.

**Efficiency and Consistency**

The strategy's Sortino Ratio and Calmar Ratio are not provided, making it difficult to assess its efficiency and consistency. These metrics would provide valuable insights into the strategy's risk-adjusted returns and its ability to generate consistent profits.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands strategy has several areas for improvement:

1. **Low Returns**: The strategy's annual return is relatively low, suggesting that it may not be generating sufficient returns to justify the risks taken.
2. **Inefficient Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the strategy is not efficient in terms of risk-adjusted returns.
3. **High Drawdown**: The maximum drawdown of 20.40% is relatively high, suggesting that the strategy is exposed to significant potential losses.
4. **Lack of Efficiency and Consistency Metrics**: The absence of Sortino Ratio and Calmar Ratio metrics makes it difficult to assess the strategy's efficiency and consistency.

To improve the strategy's performance, I would recommend:

1. **Optimizing Position Sizing**: Refine the position sizing algorithm to optimize returns while managing risk.
2. **Refining Entry and Exit Rules**: Re-evaluate the entry and exit rules to improve the strategy's ability to generate profitable trades.
3. **Enhancing Risk Management**: Consider implementing additional risk management measures, such as volatility-based position sizing or dynamic stop-losses.
4. **Monitoring and Refining the Strategy**: Continuously monitor the strategy's performance and refine its parameters to improve its efficiency and consistency.
