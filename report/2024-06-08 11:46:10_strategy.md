# Strategy Description:
Here is a concise and simple quantitative trading strategy:

**Strategy:** Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands

**Stock Selection:** Any liquid stock with a minimum 1-year price history

**Entry Rules:**

1. Calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the stock's closing price.
2. Calculate the 2-standard deviation Bollinger Bands around the 20-day SMA.
3. When the stock's closing price touches or breaks below the lower Bollinger Band, buy the stock.
4. When the stock's closing price touches or breaks above the upper Bollinger Band, sell the stock.

**Exit Rules:**

1. Set a stop-loss at 2% below the entry price.
2. Set a take-profit at 2% above the entry price.

**Position Sizing:** Allocate 2% of the trading account to each trade.

**Risk Management:** Maximum daily loss limit is 1% of the trading account.

This strategy is based on the idea that stock prices tend to revert to their mean over time. The Bollinger Bands provide a quantitative measure of volatility, and the strategy takes advantage of extreme price movements by buying low and selling high.

# Strategy Performance:
PerformanceMetrics(sharpe=-5.649604228683291, drawdown=1.9748891023660835, annual_return=-0.0576752372708666, total_trades=1, winning_trades=0, losing_trades=0)

# Analysis:
**Performance Analysis of Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands Strategy**

Based on the provided statistics, I will conduct a thorough analysis of the strategy's performance.

**Risk-Adjusted Return:**
The Sharpe Ratio, which measures the strategy's excess return per unit of risk, is -5.65. This is an extremely low value, indicating that the strategy's return is not sufficient to compensate for the risk taken. A negative Sharpe Ratio suggests that the strategy is not generating returns that justify the risk exposure.

**Drawdown:**
The maximum drawdown of 1.9749 (or approximately 19.75%) is a significant concern. This indicates that the strategy has experienced a substantial decline in value at some point, which could be a major setback for investors.

**Annual Return:**
The annual return of -0.0577 (or approximately -5.77%) is a negative value, implying that the strategy has lost value over the evaluation period. This is a disappointing result, as investors expect a positive return on their investments.

**Trade Performance:**
The strategy has executed only 1 trade, with 0 winning trades and 0 losing trades. This limited trading activity makes it challenging to draw meaningful conclusions about the strategy's performance.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Poor Risk-Return Profile:** The strategy's Sharpe Ratio and annual return indicate that it is not generating sufficient returns to compensate for the risk taken.
2. **High Drawdown Risk:** The maximum drawdown is substantial, which could lead to significant losses for investors.
3. **Limited Trading Activity:** The strategy has executed only 1 trade, making it difficult to assess its performance and reliability.
4. **No Winning Trades:** The strategy has not generated any profitable trades, which raises concerns about its ability to identify profitable opportunities.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Re-evaluate the Strategy:** Consider refining the strategy's parameters, such as the moving average period, Bollinger Band settings, or position sizing, to improve its performance.
2. **Increase Trading Activity:** The strategy should be optimized to generate more trades, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of its performance.
3. **Risk Management:** Implement more robust risk management techniques to mitigate the impact of large drawdowns and losses.
4. **Monitor and Refine:** Continuously monitor the strategy's performance and refine it as needed to improve its risk-return profile.

In conclusion, the Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands strategy requires significant improvements to become a viable trading strategy. The current performance statistics are concerning, and the strategy's risk-return profile needs to be addressed to attract investors.
