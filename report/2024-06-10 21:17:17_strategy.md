# Strategy Description:
**Improved Strategy Description:**

**Strategy:** Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands

**Stock Selection:** Any liquid stock with a minimum 5-year price history

**Entry Rules:**

1. Calculate the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the stock's closing price.
2. Calculate the 2-standard deviation Bollinger Bands around the 50-day SMA.
3. When the stock's closing price touches the lower Bollinger Band, buy the stock.
4. When the stock's closing price touches the upper Bollinger Band, sell the stock.

**Exit Rules:**

1. Set a stop-loss at 3% below the entry price.
2. Set a take-profit at 3% above the entry price.

**Position Sizing:** Allocate 1.5% of the trading account to each trade, with a maximum of 5 open positions at any given time.

**Risk Management:**

1. Monitor the strategy's performance regularly and adjust position sizing based on the trading account's performance.
2. Implement a maximum daily loss limit of 2% of the trading account.
3. Implement a maximum weekly loss limit of 4% of the trading account.

**Backtesting:**

The strategy will be backtested over a 10-year period with a dataset of 500 liquid stocks. The backtesting results will be used to refine the strategy and optimize its performance.

**Performance Metrics:**

The strategy's performance will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. Annual Return
2. Sharpe Ratio
3. Drawdown
4. Total Trades
5. Winning Trades
6. Losing Trades
7. Average Trade Return
8. Average Trade Duration

By addressing the critique's recommendations, this improved strategy aims to provide more reliable statistics and a more robust risk management approach to inform trading decisions.

# Analysis:
**Detailed Analysis of the Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands Strategy**

Based on the provided statistics, I will analyze the performance of the Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands strategy and provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses.

**Return Analysis**

The strategy has generated an annual return of 7.56%, which is a decent return considering the risk management approach implemented. However, it's essential to evaluate this return in the context of the risk taken.

**Risk Analysis**

The strategy's Sharpe Ratio is 0.465, indicating that the return generated is relatively low compared to the risk taken. A Sharpe Ratio above 1 is generally considered good, while a ratio below 1 indicates that the return is not sufficient to compensate for the risk.

The maximum drawdown of 25.33% is a significant concern, as it suggests that the strategy is exposed to substantial potential losses. This drawdown is likely to be a result of the strategy's reliance on mean reversion, which can be vulnerable to prolonged periods of non-mean-reverting market behavior.

**Trade Analysis**

The strategy has executed only 1 trade, which is an extremely low number of trades. This could be due to the strict entry and exit rules, which may not be triggered frequently. The lack of trading activity may result in underutilization of the trading account.

**Position Sizing and Risk Management**

The strategy allocates 1.5% of the trading account to each trade, with a maximum of 6 open positions at any given time. This position sizing approach is relatively conservative, which is a positive aspect of the strategy. The risk management approach, including the stop-loss and take-profit rules, as well as the maximum daily and weekly loss limits, is well-structured and should help to mitigate potential losses.

**Conclusion**

The Mean Reversion with Bollinger Bands strategy has generated a decent annual return, but it is accompanied by a significant drawdown and a relatively low Sharpe Ratio. The strategy's trading activity is extremely low, which may result in underutilization of the trading account. To improve the strategy's performance, I would recommend the following:

1. Refine the entry and exit rules to increase trading activity while maintaining a robust risk management approach.
2. Consider implementing a more dynamic position sizing approach to optimize the allocation of trading capital.
3. Monitor the strategy's performance regularly and adjust the risk management parameters as needed to minimize potential losses.

By addressing these areas, the strategy can potentially improve its overall performance and provide a more reliable source of returns for investors.
